<PRE>Hi members or are you still a member?

Do you remember the NNW project. I am sending emails and chronicles and are 
you still alive.

Some members haven't replied for many months now.

Normal is one social email a month to stay a member. That could be a 
oneliner. But I think many of the members have forgotten this project.

So we are getting new members who can show some commitment. Without 
commitment we can't reach anything.

I wish you a very good life.
