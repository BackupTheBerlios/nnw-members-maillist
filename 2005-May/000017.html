<PRE>How are you.

I have posted on a mathematical site,

<A HREF="http://mathforum.org">http://mathforum.org</A>

In our project we only email friendly. That means
that we can easier listen to each other so we
learn more from each other. And that means we
are stimulating each other.

We are coming from different directions and we
meet each other here. And we don't know each other
enough to say. I know about a special thing more
than you. We can't simply tell that beforehand.

So listening is very important.

That was the biggest problem on that
Mathematical site. They fought for their own
opinions; not listening to other people. And
in this way we come farther than anyone else.

I have put papers on the berlios site for difficult
mathematical problems. But what we do here.

I think that we know today less than tomorrow. We can
always meet solutions or more information. And that
means we work in versions from rough to more precise.

That means our algorithm are first rough in just the
common language. And they go also in versions from
rough to precise. And we can only phrase precise
when we have already made codes from it.

Phrasing in a computer language is a help for that.

It's a productive way. But not everyone knows this way.

I do a lot of promoting because that is vital for us.

The papers for mathematics and sciences are also written in
an informal way. So readers can get a feeling for it. They
can draw pictures. They can become in touch with that subject
then. They can phrase it in own words. It can become their
subject.

Later that will be papers for schools.

You can now we promote also a New ERA, based on forgotten
papers from famous scientists.

You can google for - layers everywhere or
for - factual thinking

and more of us.

In my own country I am sending charm emails to conquer the
hearts of the people. Giving some nice things to read.

We need also translators of course. Only our SQUID demo
has to go on as well. The new sources are on computers from
different members. And interested people can get them.

Also we have to survive. And I do my best to get more
members. It's very quiet now.

Pleas have a nice week.
