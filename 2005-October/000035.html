<PRE>Hi members or are you still a member?

Do you remember the NNW project?

I am sick of sending emails and chronicles when a member doesn't do 
anything for this project.

Those members have till 15 November 2005 the time to send me an email that 
they want to do something for this project and otherwise we can better take 
the decision that you go away.

Squid is still the same as a year ago. And that I see as very bad for the 
older members. My hope is on the new members.

Is that very clear.
