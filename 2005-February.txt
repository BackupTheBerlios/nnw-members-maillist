Hello everyone

My name is Pablo Rodr?guez Madro?o and I have just
joined NNW. I am still a bit confused about what the
project is about, but as I have read somewhere else
one can only learn to walk by walking...

I am from Spain, and I have studied Applied
Mathematics. Currently I am studying Computer Science
while working. I am developing an optimal control
system for drinking water.

I have joined the project because I was looking for a
Free Software project to contribute to, and I came
across NNW on SourceForge. It attracted me because of
the scientifical background and because I wasn't able
to guess what it was about :-)))

I hope to help soon, but now I am trying to read the
docs, download the soft and test it!

Bye!
