Hi,

I have promoted with many posting on the math forum.

There was also someone who believed that in a normal computer
an infinity space could be. I thought that all atoms of the
universe weren't enough for that. But he disagreed with me.

I have spread our views there. So they know now of us.

We work in versions. Because the principle to morrow we can
know more than today. And that means also that we can
formulate things more precise than in the beginning

We are building on forgotten papers from famous scientists.

But I have now written more than 30 papers about mathematics
for the 21st century. And from that we are right in our
direction. Of course that are also good people.

Please have a great drink,


ed van der meulen

A weekend and

Time to sleep...


How well known is the notion "on a running train" ? What do you think?

My examples:

1. cron 56

Who are forgetting those things. The trains of followers who don't know 
where those trains are heading to. Those who don't look back how it 
started. Trains that run through the country often they think they are in 
reality. Only they are certainly wrong.

2. intro-chao

We are standing high above the trains. We see the railways. And we see a 
kind of dots that are probably the people, the commuters,. maybe ramblers, 
vagabonds and that kind of people as well. Only disordered dots to see. But 
then. Look...

3. ft-i

We are very well documented. And what do we people of the open source 
community. Staying in the truth. Or following the running trains to nowhere.

4. intro-chao

The very critical mathematician who overlooked all mathematics in his time 
and was a great man. He liked physics and philosophy. Henri Jules Poincar?. 
Much more critical than those many people now. A honest scientist. Now many 
people are followers of running trains where nobody is looking for where 
it's heading to. Neither where they were coming from. Forgetting the 
remaining people. Alone on that trains.

In contrast we look more precise what people have said. Many other people 
are running away with a first for them understandable idea.

We know many people thought our earth was flat as well. Some time ago.

We have to do a lot of promoting otherwise we will be forgotten soon.
I have written hopefully papers for mathematicians as well. More than 30 
papers.

The weekend is great. Sailing over the New Night Waves? Music in the air?

The story goes.

As almost always, I'm busy with my college work and my exams, but the
weather is really fine, 30?C sunny, no wind, perfect to be at the beach :)
Have an excellent weekend everybody!

Hi Members

All well with you.

Some news about the ERA.

We have had a referendum about something like the European constitution.

I have also emailed don't trust the Government. and that we weren't a part 
of thinking about that constitution. That is not Democratic for us. Only 
that you can tell yes or now?

And the people in my country have voted, No. While the big political 
parties told the people vote Yes. But the people listened to us instead.For 
I send reliable emails.

And what has happened today. One of the Government parties the biggest one 
have sent me an email.

That was a surprise for me.

So you can see we are not far from a success in this country.

This was good news to me.

I am sending charm emails with nice subjects. Not a so bad idea.

Sleep sweet,

ed

Hi members NNW

I like to tell you the ERA is really at hand and in this way accepting our 
views on the world.

I spent now time to my own small country. And I hope you will like it.

I have promoted it form April 2003. So now more than 2 years. With more 
than 250 emails full of true information and some I have ported to html and 
now those papers are to see on the sites of us. The Berlios site is most up 
to date.

I have also put papers on the Berlios site about Mathematics and sciences 
for the 21st Century.

I also wrote a paper about all our results till May 2005, which is already 
a long list.

I am updating the Berlios sites and the SourceForge site on a daily basis.

And as always I promote also active members. Provided they also want that.

By the defeat of the government they know we are important for the world.

That was the no against the EU constitution. Not because that was a bad 
constitution. Only because they didn't listen to anybody in this country. A 
government without any ears. And I have spread that. So bad from me.

And there will become another time to accept that constitution. But we like 
that people from us have a close look on it as well. And not then we only 
can vote yes or no. That we don't see as democratic.

They will work in our ways. More productive and always in friendly way.

Later I will tell about it more and you can ask questions as well.

Have please a nice week,

ed

Hi

All is well here

How are you?

It's very quiet on the mermerslist. Have I sent the NNW chroncle for 
nothing? It was some work for me.

Too busy myself, my best monitor up and died so I am a bit swamped with it all
apart trying to troubleshoot it. Plus I started a sourceforge project to extend an application
from another project.

Will read through the chronicle a little later (tonight?).

Thanks.


Raymond

Hi

Maybe you know in many countries the money for the high schools are saved 
for other things like wars. And the ERA promoting is in this country nearly 
completed. With the next general elections the ERA will be a fact. And I 
say finally. It was huge effort. And ERA is for world peace. So the high 
schools can be improved. The level of high schools is very low here. We 
have now also a very bad government. That listen to nobody. Isolated from 
the population here.

The subject that has suffered is mathematics, while in is important for all 
sciences and also technical studies.

So the first good action is to improve the lessons about mathematics. That 
I see as clear. And II have put many papers on the Berlios site for that 
target.

Two groups of papers.

1. Difficult mathematical proofs I have explains in easy term and 
informally so student can be come in touch with it. They can understand it. 
Not hindered by the mathematical language. That also makes it difficult.

2. Introduction for beginner in
    a. mathematical induction, which a vital tool
    b. sine an cosine
    c. Pythagoras, theorem to the bottom

I have tried tom make as a feast and motivation for the students. And also 
that everything becomes clear.

I again work in versions so I can improve them as well. But they are 
already for high schools. And in the ERA we will used them.

Other subjects will follow as well.

To go to a high school has to become a feast for everybody.

What do you think of it.
