Hi

How are you?

It's great we have now three NNW mirror sites:

http://62.66.167.94/nnw/flash.php

http://nnw.psydolphin.net/flash.php

and

http://nnw.berlios.de/flash.php

I have made an upload tool for papers to berlios and look now the new date 
table

http://nnw.berlios.de/docs.php/by-date

And there is a lot more to see as well, like screenshots as well.

Also two daughter projects can now be seen.

http://nnw-folding.berlios.de/flash.php

This folding of proteins and chromosomes will become a welcome tool. Docs 
have to be written, There's enough to do.

And

http://nnw-np.sourceforge.net/html.php

That is something that many mathematician will surprise. And we are just 
working in the same way like in the NNW mother project, with only friendly 
emailing.

All projects support each other for promoting our views. Which is extremely 
important.

We are based on papers from famous scientists and the establishment didn't 
like it. But we are free and we do like it for sure.

I have started a series of papers about mathematics and sciences of the 
21st century. So there are many new papers on the site now.

I hope later the other mirror sites will follow the Berlios site. Each day 
I will upload things now.

By the friendly emailing and by using knowledge out of forgotten papers, we 
are running so well.

And now we need many new and enthusiastic members.

Please have a nice day

Hi Dieter

That a very well posting, thanks

Maybe this is a dangerous project for you as well. I have made papers about 
mathematics and sciences of the 21st century.

I like music, languages, sciences, and mainly a nice conversation that can 
go deep and that I never will forget. So we are only emailing each other in 
a friendly way. In this way we stimulate each other.

We have a basis from old papers from famous scientist that are forgotten by 
the establishment. So we can think a little different about various things.

We feel that we are right and we do our best. So members have to like new 
true things as well.

And we need a lot of new members. Our main concern now.

have a warm day

Hi

I have written a proper start for the non-deterministic polynomial problem 
and I have used for it our Factual Thinking that we have developed and used 
in the NNW project. That way of thinking covers all other types of 
thinking, and acting, like also day dreaming. You can also google for - 
factual thinking.

And we have now already 8 precious papers for the NNW-NP project. Early we 
can start to code for tryouts. Coding already building stones vor the NP 
project as well.

For the NNW project I have also new ideas now. We have fruitful projects now.

This has an enormous advantage. Things we learn in one of the project we 
can apply in the other projects as well. An extra possibility for free. 
Also they are stimulating each other for promoting.

That is also very important for us.

So I hope you will agree with the way we have chosen now.

Our first priority is now more new and active wanting members.

Please have a nice day

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20050412215407.025633d0@pop.unet.nl>

Hi

I hope it good with you.

Ideas form NNW, NNW-NP and NNW-foldng are often the same.

For instance

The cells of NNW are bridge between the input with maybe a question or 
something also to learn. In NNW there's not much difference between those 
learning and adm answering.

For the first something can be stored and in the other case retrieved. But 
that nearly the same.

We have off projects. All on the same true basis.

In NNW-NP we work from rough to precise and that we meet also layers. And 
then it's to bridge the highest LOD (level of detail) with the lowest LOD, 
the cities from the traveling salesman. At the highest LOD we see the total 
route.

So It's also a bridging project.

And NNW-folding. There we work also from not or hardly folded start LOD to 
a more precise compact LOD. This is also a bridging project with layers in 
it. Like also the sources of NNW reflect. Yopu also can understand the 
sources only via LODs.

In NNW-NP in NP-3 I have written a paper about our meaning of indetermistic.

For most mathematician is this the notion.

Deterministic is at each decision point we have a function that tells 
exactly this input has to go to that output. But they say indeterministic 
is not a function but a relation that tell at each decision point this 
input has to go to that SET of output. And maybe they go parallel further.

We see interministic in another way. We call that contingent. And that 
means at a decision point streams with uncertainties are meeting. That can 
be particles or people and we don't know everything form both individuals. 
This is the physical notion contingent.

We deal with the portions of uncertainty with margins. There we put the 
uncertainties. And for free we will get a lot more notions.

Suddenly we have thresholds. We have the build up of forces. We have 
breakthroughs.We have sudden nice surprises and possible also bad 
accidents. And everything a result of introducing margins.

In this way we are also bridging the gap between theories and practical 
useful tools.

What do you think of this NNW project where everything happens with 
friendly emailing.

Sleep well, grin

Hello

How are you

I have made some papers about mathematics and sciences of the 21st science. 
And why not.

We are baser on papers from famous scientists.

Our great example is Henri Jules Poincar?. Do you know that story.

In 1899 he computed by hand the orbit of the earth around the sun again. He 
did that in a more critical way.

And we can already know he was right.

Look at the tides of ebb and flood. The seas are talking to us, grin. And 
then sand coasts change. Huge volumes of same will be replaced. Dunes are 
formed and destroyed. At rocky costs we see rack pulverized and with the 
debris we can have problem. Of course there's energy needed. And so our 
earth feels that in its orbit. The orbit is less elliptical than it should 
be, and we know why.

When the Sun and the Moon and Jupiter are pulling at one side. Huge floods 
are arising, See the wild breakers. Everywhere energy dissipation. An at 
the ebb place the water feels tangential forces parallel to the surface of 
the earth.

And do you think nothing is happening in the earth itself. Surely also huge 
tensions are arising and then breakthroughs and unexpected results.

So awe adding in the squid demo margins and we are getting the rest for free.

I post also in the heart of mathematicians. But they are often believers in 
what they have learned.

And we are somewhat more critical
