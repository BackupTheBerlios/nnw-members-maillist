<PRE>A weekend and

Time to sleep...


How well known is the notion &quot;on a running train&quot; ? What do you think?

My examples:

1. cron 56

Who are forgetting those things. The trains of followers who don't know 
where those trains are heading to. Those who don't look back how it 
started. Trains that run through the country often they think they are in 
reality. Only they are certainly wrong.

2. intro-chao

We are standing high above the trains. We see the railways. And we see a 
kind of dots that are probably the people, the commuters,. maybe ramblers, 
vagabonds and that kind of people as well. Only disordered dots to see. But 
then. Look...

3. ft-i

We are very well documented. And what do we people of the open source 
community. Staying in the truth. Or following the running trains to nowhere.

4. intro-chao

The very critical mathematician who overlooked all mathematics in his time 
and was a great man. He liked physics and philosophy. Henri Jules Poincar&#233;. 
Much more critical than those many people now. A honest scientist. Now many 
people are followers of running trains where nobody is looking for where 
it's heading to. Neither where they were coming from. Forgetting the 
remaining people. Alone on that trains.

In contrast we look more precise what people have said. Many other people 
are running away with a first for them understandable idea.

We know many people thought our earth was flat as well. Some time ago.

We have to do a lot of promoting otherwise we will be forgotten soon.
I have written hopefully papers for mathematicians as well. More than 30 
papers.

The weekend is great. Sailing over the New Night Waves? Music in the air?

The story goes.
