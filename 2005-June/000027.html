<PRE>Hi

Maybe you know in many countries the money for the high schools are saved 
for other things like wars. And the ERA promoting is in this country nearly 
completed. With the next general elections the ERA will be a fact. And I 
say finally. It was huge effort. And ERA is for world peace. So the high 
schools can be improved. The level of high schools is very low here. We 
have now also a very bad government. That listen to nobody. Isolated from 
the population here.

The subject that has suffered is mathematics, while in is important for all 
sciences and also technical studies.

So the first good action is to improve the lessons about mathematics. That 
I see as clear. And II have put many papers on the Berlios site for that 
target.

Two groups of papers.

1. Difficult mathematical proofs I have explains in easy term and 
informally so student can be come in touch with it. They can understand it. 
Not hindered by the mathematical language. That also makes it difficult.

2. Introduction for beginner in
    a. mathematical induction, which a vital tool
    b. sine an cosine
    c. Pythagoras, theorem to the bottom

I have tried tom make as a feast and motivation for the students. And also 
that everything becomes clear.

I again work in versions so I can improve them as well. But they are 
already for high schools. And in the ERA we will used them.

Other subjects will follow as well.

To go to a high school has to become a feast for everybody.

What do you think of it.
