<PRE>Hello

How are you

I have made some papers about mathematics and sciences of the 21st science. 
And why not.

We are baser on papers from famous scientists.

Our great example is Henri Jules Poincar&#233;. Do you know that story.

In 1899 he computed by hand the orbit of the earth around the sun again. He 
did that in a more critical way.

And we can already know he was right.

Look at the tides of ebb and flood. The seas are talking to us, grin. And 
then sand coasts change. Huge volumes of same will be replaced. Dunes are 
formed and destroyed. At rocky costs we see rack pulverized and with the 
debris we can have problem. Of course there's energy needed. And so our 
earth feels that in its orbit. The orbit is less elliptical than it should 
be, and we know why.

When the Sun and the Moon and Jupiter are pulling at one side. Huge floods 
are arising, See the wild breakers. Everywhere energy dissipation. An at 
the ebb place the water feels tangential forces parallel to the surface of 
the earth.

And do you think nothing is happening in the earth itself. Surely also huge 
tensions are arising and then breakthroughs and unexpected results.

So awe adding in the squid demo margins and we are getting the rest for free.

I post also in the heart of mathematicians. But they are often believers in 
what they have learned.

And we are somewhat more critical
