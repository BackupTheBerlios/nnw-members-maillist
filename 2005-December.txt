Hi

In chronicle 63 I asked the members what there plan were. Some of you 
didn't reply my question which is very unfriendly in this friendly project. 
You forgot me. Do you mind I forget you?

This concerns most the developers. Not Sean not Jonathan nor Ren?, neither 
Michael.

This is then the last info you will get.

Isn't that great.

Not amused.
