<PRE>Hi,

Courage.

When I was 7 I called myself crow foot.
At 4 or 5 I put worn out batteries on
the stove. That wasn't allowed so I fled
behind a big chair and protected myself.
Only nothing happened. I had again energy
from the batteries. You could do that 2
times. Why? I didn't know.

But when I was 7 I didn't believe anymore
in the simple linear time. No time was
different.

When I was busy I forgot the time. Also strange,

And attractive forces. Also very strange.

Later I did pure mathematics. And that
means learning structures in general not really
connected to the reality. A lot of structures.

But then the leaves. All different; never I found
a same leaf. Mathematical fractals are great; but
for me an abstraction.

I studied also subjects from physics. Optics.
Relativity, Quantum mechanics and the color
quantum theories. Later for myself the superstring
theory. I like more the informal description. That
is more physical. Mathematics makes it more difficult.

And I didn't really believe in thermodynamics. It was
too statistical. Accepting uniformity, the
inhomogeneousness of the mass. But around me people
were sticking to each other.

The inhomogeneous self made pudding, so strange,
trembling. Physics and dirty mathematics extremely
difficult to make exact.

Look at Wolfram who tells about a new sciences with also
many examples of situations I as mathematic; I would run
away. I have now a paper on my sites about statistics.
A rough tool. And misused by many others who don't know
what statistics are.

And now I listen to the scientists. What interesting
is that. Very interesting people. Also the cosmologists.
Nearly wild thinkers. It's now like beginning a new
start of it. Great people as well. Also the chemistry.
Wow! what a news. And the technical people. Do you
know how to construct an aeroplane. Enormous interesting.

Do you know of nano technology. Not anymore a hype but
really interesting.

And so I have stepped further. Now the NNW project with
only friendly emailing and so listening to each other
and stimulating each other and we have extend it till
to now three open source projects and we could extend
it more.

Only the projects are for many people too new.

And only because we listen to each other.

And here it's only fighting for the own opinion. I see
this fighting as counterproductive.

Now are all big theories vulnerable. Google for - G&#246;del
the destroyer.

Or google for Popper. Who gives us the order to
falsify the theories.


And I follow that.

In that way we can improve them or make new theories.
Old ones want disappear. Like newton is yielding while
we have also the quantum theories.

All of mathematics will stay for analyzing jobs. Extremely
important. But mathematics will get also an inductive branch.
More for simulating tools and teaching to students. Then with
surprises and also maybe bad accidents. Wile deductive math
makes good reliable tools. A very well combination.

Difficult mathematical proofs, like for G&#246;del's incompleteness.
You have to read a book for it are follow lectures about it.
It's the subject proof theory of mathematics. Not a very easy
subject.

I have told it in an informal way. In that way student can get
in touch with it. They can make drawings. They can learn to apply
it. They can visualize it for themselves and others. It can grow
to their interest. And in the same time it a difficult mathematical
proof. That could be something for high schools.

I did the same for the also difficult mathematical proof
from Alonzo Church. Everyone can google for such people.

This is the mathematical proof that the Turing machine. our
computers are in instant of the Turing machine. Church proved
that the Turing machine is equivalent to the lambda theory
(LISP, maybe HASKEL). And the lambda calculus is equivalent to
the normal set theory in mathematics.

And I have also told this difficult proof informally so everyone
can understand it.

And the goal is to motivate more people for mathematics and
the sciences.

For you can say High Schools are unimportant. No I think in the
students the teachers have to lit the fire of love for such an
interesting subject. And so we can lift the level of many high
schools as well. And that with motivating lessons.

There is so much to do now.

And I send my findings to the big universities. What
should you do?

For me that isn't special. For others it could be
special. I don't know your circumstances. I know
only mine.

I wish everybody much success.
