<PRE>Hi

I hope it good with you.

Ideas form NNW, NNW-NP and NNW-foldng are often the same.

For instance

The cells of NNW are bridge between the input with maybe a question or 
something also to learn. In NNW there's not much difference between those 
learning and adm answering.

For the first something can be stored and in the other case retrieved. But 
that nearly the same.

We have off projects. All on the same true basis.

In NNW-NP we work from rough to precise and that we meet also layers. And 
then it's to bridge the highest LOD (level of detail) with the lowest LOD, 
the cities from the traveling salesman. At the highest LOD we see the total 
route.

So It's also a bridging project.

And NNW-folding. There we work also from not or hardly folded start LOD to 
a more precise compact LOD. This is also a bridging project with layers in 
it. Like also the sources of NNW reflect. Yopu also can understand the 
sources only via LODs.

In NNW-NP in NP-3 I have written a paper about our meaning of indetermistic.

For most mathematician is this the notion.

Deterministic is at each decision point we have a function that tells 
exactly this input has to go to that output. But they say indeterministic 
is not a function but a relation that tell at each decision point this 
input has to go to that SET of output. And maybe they go parallel further.

We see interministic in another way. We call that contingent. And that 
means at a decision point streams with uncertainties are meeting. That can 
be particles or people and we don't know everything form both individuals. 
This is the physical notion contingent.

We deal with the portions of uncertainty with margins. There we put the 
uncertainties. And for free we will get a lot more notions.

Suddenly we have thresholds. We have the build up of forces. We have 
breakthroughs.We have sudden nice surprises and possible also bad 
accidents. And everything a result of introducing margins.

In this way we are also bridging the gap between theories and practical 
useful tools.

What do you think of this NNW project where everything happens with 
friendly emailing.

Sleep well, grin
