<PRE>Hi Members

All well with you.

Some news about the ERA.

We have had a referendum about something like the European constitution.

I have also emailed don't trust the Government. and that we weren't a part 
of thinking about that constitution. That is not Democratic for us. Only 
that you can tell yes or now?

And the people in my country have voted, No. While the big political 
parties told the people vote Yes. But the people listened to us instead.For 
I send reliable emails.

And what has happened today. One of the Government parties the biggest one 
have sent me an email.

That was a surprise for me.

So you can see we are not far from a success in this country.

This was good news to me.

I am sending charm emails with nice subjects. Not a so bad idea.

Sleep sweet,

ed
