<PRE>Hi members NNW

I like to tell you the ERA is really at hand and in this way accepting our 
views on the world.

I spent now time to my own small country. And I hope you will like it.

I have promoted it form April 2003. So now more than 2 years. With more 
than 250 emails full of true information and some I have ported to html and 
now those papers are to see on the sites of us. The Berlios site is most up 
to date.

I have also put papers on the Berlios site about Mathematics and sciences 
for the 21st Century.

I also wrote a paper about all our results till May 2005, which is already 
a long list.

I am updating the Berlios sites and the SourceForge site on a daily basis.

And as always I promote also active members. Provided they also want that.

By the defeat of the government they know we are important for the world.

That was the no against the EU constitution. Not because that was a bad 
constitution. Only because they didn't listen to anybody in this country. A 
government without any ears. And I have spread that. So bad from me.

And there will become another time to accept that constitution. But we like 
that people from us have a close look on it as well. And not then we only 
can vote yes or no. That we don't see as democratic.

They will work in our ways. More productive and always in friendly way.

Later I will tell about it more and you can ask questions as well.

Have please a nice week,

ed
