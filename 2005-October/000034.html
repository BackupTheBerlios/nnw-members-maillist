<PRE>Hi members or are you still a member?

Do you remember the NNW project?

For me a right member emails at least once a month a message. And in a busy 
month there is always time to work a quarter of an hour for this project.

I am not glad with the sleepers now. I'm glad with the new members who show 
really commitment for this friendly project. A sleeper is like no member at 
all.

I wish you a very good life.
