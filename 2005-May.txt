Hi,

I posted on a mathematical site without much success. People believe in 
their own things and often don't want to learn more. I did my best.

I have no idea why it's so quiet here, hardly emails from members anymore. 
All busy so much?

Please have a lovely drink,

ed

Hi Ed,
In fact, I'm actually busy, but nevertheless, I'm alive and soon (in two
months time), I will actually be on holydays, I can hardly wait!
Best regards everybody!

Note: Sunny day in Portugal, nice weather to go to the beach, and I'm stuck

Great! Afonso. Good to hear from you. Holidays, yes. Very needed.

A little bit cold here in the North. But sunny weather nevertheless.

I am studying also more and putting my findings on the sites. We learn all 
the time.

Have a splendid time Afonso,

Subject: [Nnw-members] Hi everybody
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20050529212118.024f6970@pop.unet.nl>

How are you.

I have posted on a mathematical site,

http://mathforum.org

In our project we only email friendly. That means
that we can easier listen to each other so we
learn more from each other. And that means we
are stimulating each other.

We are coming from different directions and we
meet each other here. And we don't know each other
enough to say. I know about a special thing more
than you. We can't simply tell that beforehand.

So listening is very important.

That was the biggest problem on that
Mathematical site. They fought for their own
opinions; not listening to other people. And
in this way we come farther than anyone else.

I have put papers on the berlios site for difficult
mathematical problems. But what we do here.

I think that we know today less than tomorrow. We can
always meet solutions or more information. And that
means we work in versions from rough to more precise.

That means our algorithm are first rough in just the
common language. And they go also in versions from
rough to precise. And we can only phrase precise
when we have already made codes from it.

Phrasing in a computer language is a help for that.

It's a productive way. But not everyone knows this way.

I do a lot of promoting because that is vital for us.

The papers for mathematics and sciences are also written in
an informal way. So readers can get a feeling for it. They
can draw pictures. They can become in touch with that subject
then. They can phrase it in own words. It can become their
subject.

Later that will be papers for schools.

You can now we promote also a New ERA, based on forgotten
papers from famous scientists.

You can google for - layers everywhere or
for - factual thinking

and more of us.

In my own country I am sending charm emails to conquer the
hearts of the people. Giving some nice things to read.

We need also translators of course. Only our SQUID demo
has to go on as well. The new sources are on computers from
different members. And interested people can get them.

Also we have to survive. And I do my best to get more
members. It's very quiet now.

Pleas have a nice week.

ed

Subject: [Nnw-members] An example of a posting on a mathematical site
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20050530001955.024f6970@pop.unet.nl>

Hi,

Courage.

When I was 7 I called myself crow foot.
At 4 or 5 I put worn out batteries on
the stove. That wasn't allowed so I fled
behind a big chair and protected myself.
Only nothing happened. I had again energy
from the batteries. You could do that 2
times. Why? I didn't know.

But when I was 7 I didn't believe anymore
in the simple linear time. No time was
different.

When I was busy I forgot the time. Also strange,

And attractive forces. Also very strange.

Later I did pure mathematics. And that
means learning structures in general not really
connected to the reality. A lot of structures.

But then the leaves. All different; never I found
a same leaf. Mathematical fractals are great; but
for me an abstraction.

I studied also subjects from physics. Optics.
Relativity, Quantum mechanics and the color
quantum theories. Later for myself the superstring
theory. I like more the informal description. That
is more physical. Mathematics makes it more difficult.

And I didn't really believe in thermodynamics. It was
too statistical. Accepting uniformity, the
inhomogeneousness of the mass. But around me people
were sticking to each other.

The inhomogeneous self made pudding, so strange,
trembling. Physics and dirty mathematics extremely
difficult to make exact.

Look at Wolfram who tells about a new sciences with also
many examples of situations I as mathematic; I would run
away. I have now a paper on my sites about statistics.
A rough tool. And misused by many others who don't know
what statistics are.

And now I listen to the scientists. What interesting
is that. Very interesting people. Also the cosmologists.
Nearly wild thinkers. It's now like beginning a new
start of it. Great people as well. Also the chemistry.
Wow! what a news. And the technical people. Do you
know how to construct an aeroplane. Enormous interesting.

Do you know of nano technology. Not anymore a hype but
really interesting.

And so I have stepped further. Now the NNW project with
only friendly emailing and so listening to each other
and stimulating each other and we have extend it till
to now three open source projects and we could extend
it more.

Only the projects are for many people too new.

And only because we listen to each other.

And here it's only fighting for the own opinion. I see
this fighting as counterproductive.

Now are all big theories vulnerable. Google for - G?del
the destroyer.

Or google for Popper. Who gives us the order to
falsify the theories.


And I follow that.

In that way we can improve them or make new theories.
Old ones want disappear. Like newton is yielding while
we have also the quantum theories.

All of mathematics will stay for analyzing jobs. Extremely
important. But mathematics will get also an inductive branch.
More for simulating tools and teaching to students. Then with
surprises and also maybe bad accidents. Wile deductive math
makes good reliable tools. A very well combination.

Difficult mathematical proofs, like for G?del's incompleteness.
You have to read a book for it are follow lectures about it.
It's the subject proof theory of mathematics. Not a very easy
subject.

I have told it in an informal way. In that way student can get
in touch with it. They can make drawings. They can learn to apply
it. They can visualize it for themselves and others. It can grow
to their interest. And in the same time it a difficult mathematical
proof. That could be something for high schools.

I did the same for the also difficult mathematical proof
from Alonzo Church. Everyone can google for such people.

This is the mathematical proof that the Turing machine. our
computers are in instant of the Turing machine. Church proved
that the Turing machine is equivalent to the lambda theory
(LISP, maybe HASKEL). And the lambda calculus is equivalent to
the normal set theory in mathematics.

And I have also told this difficult proof informally so everyone
can understand it.

And the goal is to motivate more people for mathematics and
the sciences.

For you can say High Schools are unimportant. No I think in the
students the teachers have to lit the fire of love for such an
interesting subject. And so we can lift the level of many high
schools as well. And that with motivating lessons.

There is so much to do now.

And I send my findings to the big universities. What
should you do?

For me that isn't special. For others it could be
special. I don't know your circumstances. I know
only mine.

I wish everybody much success.
