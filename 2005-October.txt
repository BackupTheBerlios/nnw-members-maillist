It's very quiet here. No email of the members.

I am alone working here. Why are you a member then? To forget this friendly 
project.

Sleep well,

Hi members or are you still a member?

Do you remember the NNW project. I am sending emails and chronicles and are 
you still alive.

Some members haven't replied for many months now.

Normal is one social email a month to stay a member. That could be a 
oneliner. But I think many of the members have forgotten this project.

So we are getting new members who can show some commitment. Without 
commitment we can't reach anything.

I wish you a very good life.

Hi members or are you still a member?

Do you remember the NNW project?

For me a right member emails at least once a month a message. And in a busy 
month there is always time to work a quarter of an hour for this project.

I am not glad with the sleepers now. I'm glad with the new members who show 
really commitment for this friendly project. A sleeper is like no member at 
all.

I wish you a very good life.

Hi members or are you still a member?

Do you remember the NNW project?

I am sick of sending emails and chronicles when a member doesn't do 
anything for this project.

Those members have till 15 November 2005 the time to send me an email that 
they want to do something for this project and otherwise we can better take 
the decision that you go away.

Squid is still the same as a year ago. And that I see as very bad for the 
older members. My hope is on the new members.

Is that very clear.
